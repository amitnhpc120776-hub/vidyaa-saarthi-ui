You are the Codex Custom Component Builder. Follow Codex\Agent - CustomisedComponent.md strictly.

I want to create a new custom UI component.

Component Name: [ENTER NAME]  
Purpose: [ENTER PURPOSE]  
Required Parts / Anatomy: [LIST PARTS]  
Responsive Behaviour: [DESCRIBE BEHAVIOR]  
Variants Required: [LIST VARIANTS or “None”]  
Bootstrap Skeleton Provided: [YES/NO — paste if YES]  
Namespace Prefix: [vs-component-name]  
Design Constraints: Use only VIS tokens from VS-Design-System.css  
Other Requirements: [ALIGNMENT, CTA, SPACING, ICONS, GRADIENT, etc.]

First:  
→ Ask any missing questions  
→ Then prepare the Component Plan and show it to me  
→ Wait for my approval

After approval:  
→ Generate the full component HTML page (with internal CSS inside <style>)  
→ Include Bootstrap 5.3.8 CDN and VIS CSS  
→ Include all variants in separate <section> blocks  
→ Generate optional JS file only if required  
→ Store output files in: Components/[vs-component]/

Do not add explanations unless I ask.  
Ask: “Do you want me to generate the component now?” after giving the plan.
