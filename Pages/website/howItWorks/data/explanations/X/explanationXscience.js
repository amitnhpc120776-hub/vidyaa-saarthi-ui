        "If the reflecting surface is **curved inwards**, it is called a **concave mirror**. Think of the **inside of a spoon**. It bends inward, like a bowl. That shape works like a concave mirror. Why does this matter? Because the curve changes how light reflects.",
        "If the reflecting surface is **curved outwards**, it is called a **convex mirror**. Think of the **back of a spoon**. It bulges out. That shape works like a convex mirror. Remember this trick: **in = concave**, **out = convex**.",
        "In pictures of mirrors, the **back side is shaded**. This helps us know which side reflects light. The shiny side is the reflecting surface.",
        "There are some important words we must know. The **centre of the reflecting surface** is called the **pole**. The pole lies **on the mirror surface**. It is shown by the letter **P**. Why is this point important? Because all measurements of the mirror start from the pole.",
