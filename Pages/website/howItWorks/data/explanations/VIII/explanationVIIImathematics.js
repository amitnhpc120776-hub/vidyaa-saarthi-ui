        "Here we are adding **consecutive numbers**. Consecutive numbers are numbers that come **one after another**, like 3 and 4, or 4, 5, and 6. There is **no gap** between them. Think of them as **steps on a staircase**.",

        "Now Anshu starts thinking. He asks some questions. Can **every natural number** be written as a sum of consecutive numbers? Can some numbers be written in **many ways**? He also notices that **odd numbers** can be written as the sum of **two consecutive numbers**. Then he wonders about **even numbers** and even about **0**, and whether negative numbers are needed. Why do some numbers work easily while others do not? This is what he wants to explore.",
