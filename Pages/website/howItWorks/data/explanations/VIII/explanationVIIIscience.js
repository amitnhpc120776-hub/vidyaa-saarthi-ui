When the bag has **broad straps**, the weight spreads over a **larger area**. This feels less painful. Think of it like standing on one foot versus standing on two feet. Why does standing on two feet feel easier?",

        "When we carry a bag, we feel its weight because of the **force of gravity** pulling it down on our shoulders. If the straps are narrow, the weight presses on a **small area** of the shoulder. If the straps are broad, the same weight spreads over a **larger area**.",
        "Because the weight is spread over a larger area in Megha’s bag, it feels less painful. This shows that the **size and shape of the straps do make a difference**. Why does spreading weight help? Because pressure reduces when the same force acts on a larger area.",
