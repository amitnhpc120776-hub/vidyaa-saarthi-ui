        "When we see **stars**, we see the **past**. Star light travels for many **years**. Nearby objects are seen **immediately**. Like a **delayed message**, star light reaches us late. Why does light take time to reach?",
        "The **origin of life** is a **special event** in the **universe**. The universe is very **large**. The **Earth** is very **small**. Think of Earth as a **dot on a big map**. Why is Earth called tiny?",
        "The **universe is very old**, about **13.8 billion years**. It has many **galaxies**. Galaxies contain **stars**, **gas**, and **dust**. Remember: galaxy means a **group of stars**. Why are galaxies grouped?",
        "The **Big Bang theory** explains how the universe began. It suggests a **huge explosion**. The universe **expanded**. As it expanded, it **cooled down**. Like hot food cooling slowly. Why does expansion cause cooling?",
        "**Hydrogen** and **helium** formed later. These gases came together due to **gravity**. They formed **galaxies**. In the **Milky Way**, **Earth formed** about **4.5 billion years ago**. Why does gravity pull things together?",

        "When we look at stars in a clear night sky, we are not seeing them as they are now. Light from stars takes a very long time to travel. The light we see today started its journey millions of years ago. So, looking at stars is like looking into the past. Objects near us are seen immediately, so we see them in the present.",
        "The origin of life is considered a very special event in the history of the universe. The universe is extremely large, while the Earth is very small in comparison, almost like a tiny speck. The universe is also very old, about 13.8 billion years old.",
        "The universe contains huge groups of galaxies. Galaxies have stars along with clouds of gas and dust. One theory that explains how the universe began is the Big Bang theory. According to this idea, the universe started with a massive explosion. As the universe expanded, it became cooler.",
        "After some time, simple gases like hydrogen and helium were formed. These gases slowly came together due to gravitational force and formed galaxies. In the Milky Way galaxy, our Earth is believed to have formed around 4.5 billion years ago.",
