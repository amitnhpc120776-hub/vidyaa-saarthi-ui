        "If the farmer uses **1 hectare land** and **2 hours labour**, he gets **2 tonnes wheat**. This relation is written as a function. It shows how inputs give output. Like a recipe giving final food. Why write it as a function?",
        "The relation can be written as $q = K \\times L$. Here **q** is wheat produced. **K** is land area. **L** is labour hours. If K or L increases, q increases. More input gives more output. Why does output rise?",
        "A production function shows **efficient use** of inputs. Efficient means no waste. You cannot get more output from same inputs. It is like using full marks from same study time. Why is efficiency important?",

        "A production function explains the link between inputs used by a firm and the output it produces. For different amounts of inputs, it shows the highest possible output that can be made. In simple words, it tells us how much output can be produced when certain inputs are used efficiently.",
        "To understand this, think of a farmer who grows wheat using only two inputs: land and labour. The production function shows the maximum quantity of wheat the farmer can produce with a given area of land and a given number of labour hours. For example, if the farmer uses 1 hectare of land and 2 hours of labour in a day, and this results in a maximum of 2 tonnes of wheat, this relationship is described by a production function.",
        "One way to write this relationship is using an equation: $q = K \\times L$. Here, q represents the quantity of wheat produced, K stands for the area of land in hectares, and L shows the number of labour hours per day. If either land or labour increases, the output will also increase. For any fixed amount of land and labour, there is only one maximum level of output.",
        "A production function always assumes efficient use of inputs. This means it is not possible to produce more output with the same amount of inputs. It is also defined for a given level of technology. When technology improves, more output can be produced using the same inputs, and this leads to a new production function.",
