        "**Amines** come from **ammonia**. In ammonia, hydrogen atoms are present. In amines, one, two, or three hydrogens are **replaced** by **alkyl or aryl groups**. Think: ammonia is the base model. Why replace hydrogen?",
        "Like **ammonia**, amines have a **nitrogen atom**. Nitrogen is **trivalent**, so it makes three bonds. It also has **one lone pair** of electrons. Remember: three bonds, one lone pair. Why does nitrogen keep a lone pair?",
        "In amines, nitrogen uses **sp3 hybrid orbitals**. This gives a **pyramidal shape**. Three orbitals make bonds with carbon or hydrogen. The fourth orbital holds the **lone pair**. Like a tripod with a top cap. Why this shape?",
        "Because of the **lone pair**, the bond angle is **less than 109.5°**. For example, in trimethylamine it is about **108°**. The lone pair pushes bonds closer. Like elbows bending inward. Why does repulsion reduce angle?",
        "Amines are grouped as **primary**, **secondary**, and **tertiary**. This depends on how many **hydrogen atoms of ammonia** are replaced. One replacement gives **primary amine**. More replacements change the type. Why count replacements?",

        "Amines are organic compounds that are related to ammonia. They are formed when one, two, or all three hydrogen atoms of ammonia are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups. Because of this replacement, amines can be seen as modified forms of ammonia.",
        "In amines, the nitrogen atom is similar to that in ammonia. It forms three bonds and has one lone pair of electrons that is not shared. The nitrogen atom uses sp³ hybrid orbitals, which gives amines a pyramidal shape.",
        "The three sp³ hybrid orbitals of nitrogen overlap with hydrogen or carbon atoms, depending on the type of amine. The fourth orbital contains the unshared pair of electrons. Because of this lone pair, the bond angle between carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen or carbon is slightly less than 109.5°. For example, in trimethylamine, this angle is about 108°.",
        "Amines are grouped into primary, secondary, and tertiary amines based on how many hydrogen atoms of ammonia are replaced. When one hydrogen is replaced by an alkyl or aryl group, a primary amine is formed. When two hydrogens are replaced, a secondary amine is formed, and when all three hydrogens are replaced, a tertiary amine is formed.",
