      text: `The Constitution makers decided that universal adult franchise
            would be a feature of Indian democracy right from the outset.
            This means that every adult citizen gets one vote, and all votes
            have equal value. Hence, every Indian citizen aged 18 and
            above has the right to vote — irrespective of caste, creed, race,
            religion, gender, education, income, etc. The word ‘universal’
            connotes this.
            
            Universal franchise is a cornerstone of Indian democracy.
            Elections to the Lok Sabha, the legislative assembly of every
            state and union territory, and all the local elections in villages
            and cities are based on universal franchise (Article 326 of the
            Constitution). Remember that no one can vote on another’s
            behalf.
            
            To be able to exercise your right, you need to be registered as a
            voter in your constituency. However, one is barred from voting
            if found guilty of committing certain serious crimes.
            
            Do you remember India had a general election in the summer
            of 2024? About 980 million voters were eligible to exercise their
            franchise for the 543 constituencies of the Lok Sabha.
            
            We need an elaborate and well-organised system to manage this
            massive exercise and ensure that the elections take place fairly
            and freely. In this chapter, we will briefly explore who can vote,
            a few of the types of elections we have, the electoral system, and
            how it is organised.`,
