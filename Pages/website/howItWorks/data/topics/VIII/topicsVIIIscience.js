      text: `Megha and her brother Pawan are going on a picnic. They walk
        to the picnic spot, carrying identical items in their bags (Fig. 6.1).
        On the way, Pawan keeps adjusting his bag, and looks
        uncomfortable. Megha asks, “Is there a problem with
        your bag?” Pawan responds, “Yes, it is hurting my
        shoulders.” Megha says, “Both our bags are equally
        heavy. Why does your bag hurt, and mine doesn’t?”
        Pawan reflects for a minute and says, “Perhaps, it is
        because of the difference in the straps of our bags.
        My bag has narrow straps while your bag has broad
        straps.”

        Can the shape or size of the straps really make a
        difference? Let us try to find out.
        When we carry a bag, we feel its weight because
        of the force of gravity acting on our shoulders. The
        weight of the bag with narrow straps acts on a
        smaller area of our shoulders, whereas the weight of
        the bag with broad straps is spread out over a larger
        area of our shoulders. `,
