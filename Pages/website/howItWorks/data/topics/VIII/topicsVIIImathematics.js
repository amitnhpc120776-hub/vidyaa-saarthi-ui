        Anshu is exploring sums of consecutive numbers. He has written the following—

        7 = 3 + 4  
        10 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4  
        12 = 3 + 4 + 5  
        15 = 7 + 8  
          = 4 + 5 + 6  
          = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5  
          
        Now, he is wondering—
        • Can I write every natural number as a sum of consecutive numbers?
        • Which numbers can I write as the sum of consecutive numbers in more than one way?
        • Ohh, I know all odd numbers can be written as a sum of two consecutive numbers. Can we write all even numbers as a sum of consecutive numbers?
        • Can I write 0 as a sum of consecutive numbers? Maybe I should use negative numbers.`,
