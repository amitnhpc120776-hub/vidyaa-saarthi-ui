      text: `Like ammonia, nitrogen atom of amines is trivalent and
            carries an unshared pair of electrons. Nitrogen orbitals
            in amines are therefore, sp3
            hybridised and the geometry
            of amines is pyramidal. Each of the three sp3
            hybridised
            orbitals of nitrogen overlap with orbitals of hydrogen or
            carbon depending upon the composition of the amines.
            The fourth orbital of nitrogen in all amines contains an
            unshared pair of electrons. Due to the presence of
            unshared pair of electrons, the angle C–N–E, (where E is
            C or H) is less than 109.5°; for instance, it is 108o
            in case of trimethylamine.
            Amines are classified as primary (1o), secondary (2o) and tertiary (3o)
            depending upon the number of hydrogen atoms replaced by alkyl or
            aryl groups in ammonia molecule. If one hydrogen atom of ammonia
            is replaced by R or Ar , we get RNH2 or ArNH2, a primary amine (1o).
            If two hydrogen atoms of ammonia or one hydrogen atom of R-NH2  are
            replaced by another alkyl/aryl(R’) group`,
