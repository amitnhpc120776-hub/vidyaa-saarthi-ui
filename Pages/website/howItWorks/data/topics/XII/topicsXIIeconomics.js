      text: `The production function of a firm is a relationship between inputs
            used and output produced by the firm. For various quantities of
            inputs used, it gives the maximum quantity of output that can be
            produced.
            Consider the farmer we mentioned above. For simplicity, we assume that the
            farmer uses only two inputs to produce wheat: land and labour. A production
            function tells us the maximum amount of wheat he can produce for a given
            amount of land that he uses, and a given number of hours of labour that he
            performs. Suppose that he uses 2 hours of labour/ day and 1 hectare of land to
            produce a maximum of 2 tonnes of wheat. Then, a function that describes this
            relation is called a production function.
            One possible example of the form this could take is:
            q = K × L,
            Where, q is the amount of wheat produced, K is the area of land in hectares,
            L is the number of hours of work done in a day.
            Describing a production function in this manner tells us the exact relation
            between inputs and output. If either K or L increase, q will also increase. For
            any L and any K, there will be only one q. Since by definition we are taking the
            maximum output for any level of inputs, a production function deals only with
            the efficient use of inputs. Efficiency implies that it is not possible to get any
            more output from the same level of inputs.

            A production function is defined for a given technology. It is the technological
            knowledge that determines the maximum levels of output that can be produced
            using different combinations of inputs. If the technology improves, the maximum
            levels of output obtainable for different input combinations increase. We then
            have a new production function.`,
