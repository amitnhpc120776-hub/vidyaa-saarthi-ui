      text: `When we look at stars on a clear night sky we are, in a
            way, looking back in time. Stellar distances are measured
            in light years. What we see today is an object whose emitted
            light started its journey millions of year back and from
            trillions of kilometres away and reaching our eyes now.
            However, when we see objects in our immediate
            surroundings we see them instantly and hence in the
            present time. Therefore, when we see stars we apparently
            are peeping into the past.
            
            The origin of life is considered a unique event in the
            history of universe. The universe is vast. Relatively speaking
            the earth itself is almost only a speck. The universe is very
            old – almost 13.8 billion years old. Huge clusters of galaxies comprise the
            universe. Galaxies contain stars and clouds of gas and dust. Considering
            the size of universe, earth is indeed a speck. The Big Bang theory attempts
            to explain to us the origin of universe. It talks of a singular huge explosion
            unimaginable in physical terms. The universe expanded and hence, the
            temperature came down. Hydrogen and Helium formed sometime later.
            The gases condensed under gravitation and formed the galaxies of the
            present day universe. In the solar system of the milky way galaxy, earth
            was supposed to have been formed about 4.5 billion years back.....`,
