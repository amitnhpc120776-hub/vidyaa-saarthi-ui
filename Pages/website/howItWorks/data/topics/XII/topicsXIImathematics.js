      text: `We see that equations (1), (2) and (3) involve independent and/or dependent variable
            (variables) only but equation (4) involves variables as well as derivative of the dependent
            variable y with respect to the independent variable x. Such an equation is called a
            differential equation.
            In general, an equation involving derivative (derivatives) of the dependent variable
            with respect to independent variable (variables) is called a differential equation.
            A differential equation involving derivatives of the dependent variable with respect
            to only one independent variable is called an ordinary differential equation, e.g.,
            
            Of course, there are differential equations involving derivatives with respect to
            more than one independent variables, called partial differential equations but at this
            stage we shall confine ourselves to the study of ordinary differential equations only.
            Now onward, we will use the term ‘differential equation’ for ‘ordinary differential
            equation.`,
