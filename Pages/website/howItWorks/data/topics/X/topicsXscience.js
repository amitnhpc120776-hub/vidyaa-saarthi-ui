      text: `The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or
        outwards. A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards,
        that is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror.
        A spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called
        a convex mirror. The schematic representation of these mirrors is shown
        in Fig. 9.1. You may note in these diagrams that the back
        of the mirror is shaded.
        You may now understand that the surface of the spoon
        curved inwards can be approximated to a concave mirror
        and the surface of the spoon bulged outwards can be
        approximated to a convex mirror.
        Before we move further on spherical mirrors, we need to
        recognise and understand the meaning of a few terms. These
        terms are commonly used in discussions about spherical
        mirrors. The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical
        mirror is a point called the pole. It lies on the surface of the
        mirror. The pole is usually represented by the letter P.
