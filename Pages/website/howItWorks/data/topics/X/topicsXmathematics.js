      intersects the circle at only one point.

      To understand the existence of the tangent to a circle at a point, let us perform
      the following activities:

      Activity 1 : Take a circular wire and attach a straight wire AB at a point P of the
      circular wire so that it can rotate about the point P in a plane. Put the system on a table
      and gently rotate the wire AB about the point P to get different positions of the straight
      wire In various positions, the wire intersects the
      circular wire at P and at another point Q1 or Q2 or
      Q3, etc. In one position, you will see that it will
      intersect the circle at the point P only (see position
      AB of AB). This shows that a tangent exists at
      the point P of the circle. On rotating further, you
      can observe that in all other positions of AB, it will
      intersect the circle at P and at another point, say R1
      or R2 or R3, etc. So, you can observe that there is
      only one tangent at a point of the circle......`,
